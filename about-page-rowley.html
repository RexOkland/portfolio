			<h2>Rowley Jefferson</h2>
			<h3>Photographer, Cartoonist, Magician, Youtube Star, Karate Expert, and Friend</h3>
			<p>Hi! My name is Rowley Jefferson. I am only a 7th grader, but being a professional photographer doesn't mean I have to be an adult. My best friend is Greg Heffley who lives down the street, it was the adventures he and I have had this year that inspired me to create this page in the first place.<br> There is plenty more to come, so make sure to comeback later and see more of me and Greg's awesome adventures, or go ahead and reach out to me to capture some of yours!</p>
