				<h2>#5</h2>
				<p>Coming in at fifth in this year's duck power ranking is the Aflac duck. While clearly not physical threat to humans or any other ducks, his influence and business expertise are what claimed his position on the top five most powerful ducks this year.</p>

				<h2>#4</h2>
				<p>Fourth most powerful duck for 2021 is the duck from the duck song youtube video. His persistance, and ability to outwit his opponents, make him a formidable opponent.</p>

				<h2>#3</h2>
				<p>Claiming the number three spot in this years power rankings are the Twitter-Famous detective ducks. They are as sophisticated as they are intelligent making them a force to be reckoned with to say the least.</p>

				<h2>#2</h2>
				<p>This year's runner up is not actually a duck, it's a goose, and an absolute unit. The goose from <em>"Untitled Goose Game"</em> is a master of both chaos and destruction. Despite all this, the actions of this goose lack any sort of thought or reason, leaving it just shy of this year's top position.</p>

				<h2>#1</h2>
				<p>Topping this years leaderboards are the ducks from Regular Show Season 2, Episode 23. They can quickly master any skill they watch, and can even combine to form a giant duck man (see image). Between these two skills they are absolutely unstoppable, and easily the most powerful duck that we know of.</p>
